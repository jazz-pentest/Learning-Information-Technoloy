# Printer Network Troubleshooting

## Problem
Admin could ping the printer, but the computer could not detect it.

##Troubleshooting steps
- Verified printer power and network connection
- Pinged printer IP to confirm network reachability
- Checked printer port configuration
- Removed duplicate ports
- Removed and re-added printer

# Key takeaway
- Successful ping confirms Layer 3 connectivity
- Power outages will affect printer network settings
- Ports can remain "in use" even after printer removal
- If privilege escalation does work, login on the device as admin.
